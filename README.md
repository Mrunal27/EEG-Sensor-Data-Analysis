# EEG-Sensor-Data-Analysis
This project is mainly about assessing human's mental health and identifying brain signals pattern.

In this project, Brain signals collected using EEG Sensor during human's different state of mind (Happy/ Angry/ Sad). 

Implemented Standard Neural Network, and Deep Neural Network, also implemented Keras LSTM model to identify human's mental health based on their brain signals.
