# EEG-Sensor-Data-Analysis
This project is mainly about assessing human's mental health and identifying brainwaves pattern.

In this project, Brain signals collected using EEG Sensor during human's different state of mind (Happy/ Angry/ Sad). 

Implemented Standard Neural Network, Deep Neural Network, RNN and also implemented Keras LSTM model to identify human's mental health based on their brain signals.
